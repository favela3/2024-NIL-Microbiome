This file contains the bioinformatics pipelines used to process the amplicon sequence. Two pipelines were used. DADA2 was used for samples with large read depth and diversity like 16SrRNA and ITS, while an usearch/qiime pipeline was used for functional gene samples. Hence, ASV were constructed for samples that were processed in DADA2 and OTUs were generated for functional gene samples.
